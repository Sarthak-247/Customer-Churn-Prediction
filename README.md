# 🔮 Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset. The goal is to build a model that identifies customers likely to stop using the service, allowing companies to take proactive retention measures.

## 🔍 Overview

Customer churn refers to customers who discontinue their service with a company. Using machine learning and data analysis techniques, we identify patterns in customer behavior and predict which customers are at risk of churning.

This project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Churn rate calculation
- Feature analysis and visualization
- Model training and prediction (optional extension)

## 📁 Dataset

**File**: `customer_churn_large_extended.csv`  
**Source**: Telecom customer records including:
- Demographics
- Service subscription details
- Payment and contract information
- Churn labels (Yes/No)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Calculate churn rate and understand customer distribution
- Visualize key features like contract type, monthly charges, and payment method
- (Optional Extension) Use supervised learning to train a predictive model for churn
